# liveware

Liveware was written for live-coding computer graphics with live musical performance. 

## Publication

Used predominately for this performance [https://toplap.org/liveware/](https://toplap.org/liveware/)

And these perfomances [https://vimeo.com/album/5132705](https://vimeo.com/album/5132705)

## Installation

OSX only, requires XCode, sol2, Lua 5.3, LuaRocks, libCinder 0.9.1, cinderblocks: MIDI2 and OSC, and Fira Code font.


## Usage

The GLSL will auto-compile. Lua sent to interpretor with <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd> for lines and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd>for blocks.

## Documentation

Lua bindings are found in LuaBindings.cpp and LuaBindings_2.cpp for objects, images, colors, math, etc. Will hopefully write better documentation for this in the future.
